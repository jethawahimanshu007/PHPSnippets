# PHPSnippets
This is a repository to demonstrate my PHP skills including my work with Regular Expressions
There are two directories in this repository:

1) HTTPAccessLogParsing: It is PHP code which parses the HTTP access log to generate reports like number and percentage of Success, Errors, top files visited, top referrers, top user agents like browsers and platforms,i.e, Operating Systems.

2) PHPSecurity: It contains code for the safest way to store login credentials of the user, user name and password. The function used is password_hash. It uses the Blowfish Hash algorithm.
